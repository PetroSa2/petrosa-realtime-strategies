make build          # Build Docker image
make container      # Test Docker container
make docker-clean   # Clean up Docker resources

# Deployment
make deploy         # Deploy to Kubernetes
make pipeline       # Run complete CI/CD pipeline
make k8s-status     # Check Kubernetes status
make k8s-logs       # View Kubernetes logs

   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Pre-commit validation

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with pytest

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

The service uses a hierarchical configuration system:

1. **Common Configuration** (`petrosa-common-config`)
   - Shared across all Petrosa services
   - NATS URL, logging, OpenTelemetry settings

2. **Service-Specific Configuration** (`petrosa-realtime-strategies-config`)
   - NATS topics and consumer settings
   - Strategy-specific parameters

3. **Secrets** (`petrosa-sensitive-credentials`)
   - Database credentials
   - API keys
   - Sensitive configuration

### VERSION_PLACEHOLDER System

The deployment system uses `VERSION_PLACEHOLDER` in Kubernetes manifests:

```yaml
image: yurisa2/petrosa-realtime-strategies:VERSION_PLACEHOLDER
```

During deployment, GitHub Actions replaces this with the actual version tag:
- `VERSION_PLACEHOLDER` â†’ `v1.2.3`
- Enables versioned deployments
- Supports rollback capabilities
- Maintains deployment history
