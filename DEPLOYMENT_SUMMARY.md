# Petrosa Realtime Strategies - Deployment Summary

## Overview

Successfully created a complete, production-ready stateless trading signal service for the Petrosa ecosystem. This service processes real-time market data from Binance WebSocket streams via NATS and generates trading signals using multiple strategies.

## Service Architecture

### Core Components

1. **NATS Consumer** (`strategies/core/consumer.py`)
   - Subscribes to `binance.websocket.data` topic
   - Handles message parsing and routing
   - Implements circuit breaker for fault tolerance
   - Supports batch processing and backpressure handling

2. **Trade Order Publisher** (`strategies/core/publisher.py`)
   - Publishes orders to `tradeengine.orders` topic
   - Implements batching and retry logic
   - Provides both async and sync publishing modes

3. **Message Processor** (`strategies/core/processor.py`)
   - Routes messages to appropriate strategy processors
   - Handles signal generation and order creation
   - Provides processing metrics and monitoring

4. **Health Server** (`strategies/health/server.py`)
   - FastAPI-based health check endpoints
   - Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
   - Comprehensive metrics and service information

5. **Data Models** (`strategies/models/`)
   - Market data models for Binance WebSocket streams
   - Signal and order models with validation
   - Comprehensive Pydantic-based data validation

## Implemented Strategies

### 1. Order Book Skew Strategy
- Analyzes order book depth for buying/selling pressure imbalances
- Configurable parameters: top levels, buy/sell thresholds, minimum spread
- Generates signals based on bid/ask ratio analysis

### 2. Trade Momentum Strategy
- Analyzes individual trades for momentum indicators
- Considers price movement, quantity, and maker/taker status
- Configurable weights and thresholds for signal generation

### 3. Ticker Velocity Strategy
- Analyzes price velocity over configurable time windows
- Monitors price change percentage and velocity thresholds
- Generates signals based on momentum and velocity patterns

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- **NATS Configuration**: URLs, topics, consumer groups
- **Strategy Parameters**: Thresholds, weights, time windows
- **Trading Configuration**: Symbols, leverage, position sizes
- **Risk Management**: Daily limits, position limits, stop losses
- **Performance**: Batch sizes, timeouts, memory limits

### Kubernetes Configuration
- **Deployment**: 3 replicas with auto-scaling (2-10 pods)
- **Resources**: 256Mi-512Mi memory, 100m-500m CPU
- **Health Checks**: Liveness, readiness, and startup probes
- **Security**: Non-root execution, read-only filesystem
- **ConfigMaps**: Service-specific configuration management
